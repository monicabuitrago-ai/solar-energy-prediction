Prediction of photovoltaic energy production based on meteorological data.

# ☀️ Solar Energy Production Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate photovoltaic solar energy production based on meteorological data. The model can support grid operators, energy analysts, or energy startups in managing supply more efficiently and improving forecast accuracy.

## 📌 Context

With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources into modern power grids, accurate forecasting of solar energy production is becoming crucial. Variations in weather conditions affect photovoltaic (PV) system output significantly. This project explores how meteorological features such as solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and time data can be used to predict energy production.
